# Wordle-Discord-Bot
Simple bot to handle daily wordles

# Intended Behavior
This discord bot will be available to users via DM or a worlde channel in a discord server. 
Every morning at 12am (in whatever the wordle timezone is) the bot will wipe everyone's access to the wordle channel.
By DM'ing the bot your wordle results it will do the following:

1. Grant you access to the wordle channel for the day.
2. Post your Worlde that you DM'd it into the chat


# Expanded features down the line:
1. You can check your wordle history
2. Adds a (customizable?) message you can display when the bot posts your wordle
3. Verify that you actually sent a wordle result to the bot
4. ???
